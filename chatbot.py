# Description: A simple chatbot that uses OpenAI's text embeddings to match user queries with predefined FAQ answers. 
# The chatbot computes the embeddings for the user input and the FAQ questions, then calculates the cosine similarity between them to find the best match. 
# If the similarity score is above a certain threshold, the chatbot returns the corresponding answer; otherwise, it provides a default response. 
# The chatbot is implemented as a Gradio interface, allowing users to interact with it through a web-based chat interface.
